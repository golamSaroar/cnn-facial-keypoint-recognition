## Facial Key-points Detection using CNN

Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Residual Blocks to detect 15 facial key-points. This project could be practically used for detecting customer emotions and facial expressions.

The notebook contains the following sections:

- Import Key libraries, dataset and visualize images.
- Perform data augmentation to increase the size of the dataset and improve model generalization capability.
- Build a deep learning model based on Convolutional Neural Network and Residual blocks using Keras with Tensorflow 2.0 as a backend.
- Compile and fit Deep Learning model to training data. 
- Assess the performance of trained CNN and ensure its generalization using various KPIs.
- Improve network performance using regularization techniques such as dropout.
